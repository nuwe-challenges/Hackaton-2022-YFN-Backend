# Hackaton-2022-YFN-Backend
# Getting Started

The project is implementing with:

## Node

Node. js, a cross-platform runtime environment for the server layer (server-side) based on JavaScript. ... js is an event-driven environment designed to create scalable applications, allowing you to establish and manage multiple connections at the same time.

## Express
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It facilitates the rapid development of Node based Web applications.

## MONGODB (MONGOOSE)

MongoDB is an open source, document-oriented, NoSQL database system. Instead of storing data in tables, as is done in relational databases.

## COMMANDER

Commander se encarga de analizar los argumentos en opciones y comandos, muestra los errores de uso en caso de problemas e implementa un sistema de ayuda.

## INQUIRER

Inquirer.js strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command line interface for Node.js (and perhaps the "CLI Xanadu").
